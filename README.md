# GitHub Readme First

## The Why

If you are like me, the first thing you do when you visit a GitHub page is to scroll down to the README.
Truth is we rarely need to view the files, at least not directly, and most of the times they are just getting in our way.

This extension hides the files block that jumps at your face:

1. The `Folders and files` section is now collapsed by default
2. You can now show the files by clicking on `Show Folders and files` or by using the `ctrl+shift+F` keyboard shortcut
3. Clicking or using the shortcut again will hide the files again

_Question for you: What's the shortcut on Mac?_

## The How

This extension is built with the very nice [WXT](https://wxt.dev/) browser extension framework.
It uses event listeners and CSS.
